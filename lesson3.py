#1 Import the randint() function from the random module

#2 Create two variables: set the number of tokens to 5 and the number of rounds to 0

#3 Create a while loop that runs so long as the user still has tokens (tokens > 0)

#4 INSIDE LOOP: Tell the user how many tokens they have

#5 INSIDE LOOP: Decrement the user's tokens and increment the game's rounds

#6 INSIDE LOOP: Randomly generate three numbers between 1 and 10

#7 INSIDE LOOP: Create a set of conditional statements that double the user's tokens if all three numbers are the same, give the user 2 more tokens if two of the numbers are the same, and do nothing if  there are no matches

#8 INSIDE LOOP: Prompt the user if they want to spend another token to play another round; if so, use the continue statement; if not, use the break statement

#9 Finally, tell the user how many rounds they played
